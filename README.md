# Dynamic_OA_for_Sprayer_UAV
Autonomous sprayer UAVs are one of the most used aerial machines used in modern agricul-ture. Non-detectable from satellite images and unreplaceable obstacles in the flying zone are one of the biggest challenges for autonomous sprayer UAVs in farmland. This work introduces an obstacle avoidance architecture specifically for sprayer UAVs. This architecture has generality in the spraying UAV problem, and it eliminates the reliance on global mapping of farmland. This approach computes the avoiding path based on the onboard sensor fusion system in re-al-time. And it autonomously determines the transition of several maneuver states using the current spraying liquid data and the UAV dynamics data obtained by offline system identifica-tion. This approach accurately tracks the avoidance path for the nonlinear time-variant spraying UAV systems.
