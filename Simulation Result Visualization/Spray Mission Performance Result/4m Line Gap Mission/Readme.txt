1. Open "four_meter_mission_Visualize.m"

2. Load obstacle data "Obstacles.mat"

3. Load Missions from mission list -----||||

		"1. LQ=0.1.mat" - Mission with 10% liquid
		"2. LQ=0.25.mat" - Mission with 25% liquid
		"3. LQ=0.5.mat" - Mission with 50% liquid
		"4. LQ=0.75.mat" - Mission with 75% liquid
		"5. LQ=1.0.mat" - Mission with 100% liquid
		
4. Run the simulation
